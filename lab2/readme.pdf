Program Summary:
This program takes in 3 randomly generated parameters: x,y and d 
and uses them to calculate a term Zcomputed. It also calculates a
second term, Zblackbox, which is Zcomputed but with a random error

The program takes the difference between the two terms, aka the error
and writes it to a file. It does this for 10,000 randomly generated x,y
and d values.

References:
No help was used on algorithms/solutions.

Internet and resources like online Python documentation, etc was used 
to help figure out things like check_output or writing to a file. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Instructions:
Type "python 8181687359tester.py" into the command line to run the program.

Type "./8181687359blackbox x y d" into command line to run just the 
C code. Replace x y and d with 3 floating point values.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Other Information:
The main limitation of this program is that the randomly generated numbers
are not true random numbers but pseudo-random numbers due to how the 
rand() and random functions work. As a result multiple runs of the same 
combination over and over will only return 1 single result.

Ex. Running "./8181687359blackbox 1 2 3" will always return the same value. 
Even though that value is randomly generated, it's not true random 
and therefore doesn't have variance over many trials.

Print statements are generally vague because Zblackbox is a string but 
needs to be converted to a float. As such if Zblackbox is a string like
"zd = 8.18" then it cannot be converted to a float.
